## Introduction
Cloud computing environments are **dynamic, with on-demand allocation and release of resources from a virtualized, shared pool.** These elastic environments enable more flexible scaling options when compared to the up-front resource allocation that is typically used in traditional on-premises data centers.

According to the *Cloud Native Computing Foundation*, cloud-native systems have the following attributes:

- Applications or processes are run in software containers as isolated units.
- Processes are managed by central orchestration processes to improve resource usage and reduce maintenance costs.
- Applications or services (microservices) are loosely coupled with explicitly described dependencies.
- 
These attributes describe a highly dynamic system that is composed of independent processes that work together to provide business value: a distributed system.
